# Power-BI-Reports-Independently-Designed-Developed


I independently created powerful and interactive Power BI reports to visualize and analyze business-critical data. These dashboards were developed entirely based on my knowledge of data modeling, DAX, and best practices in visualization design.

The goal of each report was to uncover meaningful patterns, track performance metrics, and support strategic decisions. By applying advanced analytical techniques and focusing on visual storytelling, I delivered clean, user-friendly, and scalable dashboards â€” all without relying on external tools or support.
